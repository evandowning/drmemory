Goal:
    Create a system that allows us to morph a malware's system
    call sequence such that it still accomplishes its malicious
    intent, but also does some other benign activities as well.

Steps to complete:
[ ] Have the ability to insert system call during PE's execution
[ ] Identify cases where system calls will affect future system calls
    (and potentially behavior)
[ ] Figure out how to ensure that the malware's original malicious activities
    will still be accomplished
[ ] Have the ability to do all of the above for multi-threaded binaries
[ ] Have the ability to do all of the above for multi-process binaries
[ ] Have all of the above work for real-world malware

Conflicting cases:
    Files
    Registry Keys
    Network
